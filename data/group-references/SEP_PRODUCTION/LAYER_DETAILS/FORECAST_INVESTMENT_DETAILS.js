<h3>FACILITIES INVESTMENT MODEL</h3>

<h3>1A. GAP MODELLING</h3>
<p>Forecast additional facility supply (capacity) required to meet forecast future demand by LGA and region. This is based on an assumed ‘provision rate’ (see ‘targets/standards’ item) and future demand forecast.

This helps to identify priority areas for increase in future supply. The quantum of the gap is not as important as the relativity to other areas. That is, areas with larger gaps should be priority areas for resources and further planning.</p>

<h3>2. GAP MODELLING LOCATION (SA1)</h3>
<p>Mapping of SA1 areas outside the catchment of existing facilities. This helps to identify potential location of future facilities by show areas that are outside the indicative ‘acceptable’ drive time.</p>

<h3>3. GAP MODELLING DASHBOARD</h3>
<p>Presentation of gap model data in graph format to assist analysis and planning for future facilities.</p>
