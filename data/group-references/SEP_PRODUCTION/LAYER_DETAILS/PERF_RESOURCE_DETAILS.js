<h3>PROVISION RATIOS</h3>

<h3>2A. PROVISION RATIO: MEMBERS (AREA)</h3>
<p>The ratio of the calculated facility capacity to participants in a given area. This shows areas (darker shading) that have a high number of participants relative to the capacity of facilities in the area.</p>

<h3>2B. PROVISION RATIO: DEMAND  (AREA)</h3>
