<h3>USER TIPS</h3>

<p>The following are some ‘tips’ to assist with using SportEye.</p>

<div class="scorecard">

<h3>KEY INFORMATION LAYERS</h3>

<h3>Engagement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Participation site - shows the number of members attached to a given facility.</li>
<li>Participation rate - shows relative levels of participation between areas and compared to state averages.</li>
<li>Demand conversion - shows performance of areas with respect to converting demand.
	<ul>	
		<li>High conversion shows good performance.</li>
		<li>Low conversion show poor performance.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Demand difference - shows potential for new members.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provision Ration: Demand - shows the relative provision of facilities compared to demand.
	<ul>	
		<li>Areas with a high number are those that have a relatively lower level of facility provision to meet demand.</li>
		<li>Areas with a low number are those that have a relatively high rate of facility provision to meet demand .</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change in Demand - shows the change in current and future demand and illustrates where high and low growth areas are located.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Facilities Investment Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gap Modelling - shows the indicative change in facility provision needed to meet future demand.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>INSIGHTS AND KEY INDICATORS</h3>

<p>SportsEye enables data to be viewed at various levels and from numerous perspectives to develop specific insights, identify opportunities and actions for an area. For some areas this may show the need for facility investment to access existing or future demand; for another it may show that facility provision is adequate and action around membership promotion and/or retention is required; in others, it may be a combination of these items.
</p>

<h3>Benchmarks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Areas that have relatively high conversion rates and a high number members to capacity are likely to be ‘what good looks like’ and can be a benchmark for membership and facility provision and used as a basis for gap modelling based on future demand.</li>
<li>The key provision benchmark is ‘Demand’. This provides a good balance between member and population ratios as it accounts for the profile of likely participants but is not limited to the current number of members; and considers the broader community without assuming all residents could be participants.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Facility Investment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gap modelling will indicate key areas for future facility investment. The quantum of the gap is not as important as the relativity to other areas. That is, areas with larger gaps should be priority areas for resources and further planning.</li>
<li>Areas with a lower level of provision and low level of demand conversion may be a flag for additional facility investment.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Membership development programs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Areas that have relatively good level of provision but low conversion (high difference between members and demand) may be targets for membership recruitment and/or retention campaigns.</li>
</ul><!-- END OF LIST -->

<h3>Other tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use/open multiple tabs for different enquiries at one time, this will help with cross referencing and reduce the need to turn layers on and off.</li>
<li>Click on areas and points to access additional details (not available on all layers).</li>
<li>Use dashboards to present data in graph form to complement spatial displays from the mapping.</li>
<li>Turn point layers (facilities on after area layers) - this enable pop up information on hover to display for point data.</li>
<li>Use area boundaries (and/or labels) and Satellite View under ‘Area Info’ item to assist orientation/area recognition.</li>
<li>
	Create an area snapshot - example participation report for an LGA:
	<ol>
		<li>Identify an LGA/Region - turn on area boundary.</li>
			<ul><li>Take a screen shot for age/gender breakdown.</li></ul>
		<li>Close pop up and show participation layer by suburb - turn on participation (site).</li>
			<ul><li>Take a screen shot.</li></ul>
		<li>Turn off existing areas layers and turn on demand conversion layer, show conversion in LGA relative to surrounding areas.</li>
			<ul><li>Take a screen shot.</li></ul>
		<li>Open participation dashboard and select relevant region through filters - this will show the relevant LGA along with others from the same region.</li>
			<ul><li>Take a screen shot of participation number and rate or ‘copy report’ to get graph image.</li>
			<li>Take a screen shot of demand and conversion graph - this will show relative performance of the LGA compared to others.</li></ul>
		<li>Paste images into a word document and add some titles, notes and commentary to create a participation report.</li>			
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Using a similar process, additional information on facility provision and future demand could be added along with points on Gap Modelling and Facility Priorities (the final two are more likely to be presented in text rather than maps/graphs) </li>
