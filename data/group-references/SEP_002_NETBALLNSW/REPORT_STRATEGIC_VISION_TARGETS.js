<h3>Targets / Standards</h3>
<p>The Statewide Facilities Strategy identified a broad base provision of 1 court per 3,500 of population and estimated that this would lead to a need for additional access/provision of 545 courts by 2033.</p>
<p>The model used for the analysis in this platform is based on a calculated &lsquo;capacity&rsquo; of courts and the theoretical demand for participation. The court capacity is calculated by assigning values to every court in the netball NSW inventory based on whether it is grass or hard court and whether it has sports lighting or not. A full standard court (FSC) is considered to be a functional court with lighting for training or competition. The values used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hard court with lighting = 1</li>
<li>A hard court with no lighting = 0.6</li>
<li>A grass court with no lighting = 0.4</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on analysis of provision rates and performance (demand conversion), targets have been established around the provision of netball facilities for regional and metro areas. That is, what does &lsquo;good&rsquo; look like in metro and regional areas &ndash; which areas have high conversion rates and what level of provision do they have.</p>
<p>To help model the need for access to or development of additional facilities, these &lsquo;standards&rsquo; have been developed based on current and future demand forecasts. This is more relevant than member or population standards as it is based on relevant market segments and takes in to account changes in age distribution over time.</p>
<p>The standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metro - 1 FSC court for every 300 of demand</li>
<li>Regional (1) - 1 FSC court for every 250 of demand</li>
<li>Regional (2) - 1 FSC court for every 200 of demand</li>
</ul>
