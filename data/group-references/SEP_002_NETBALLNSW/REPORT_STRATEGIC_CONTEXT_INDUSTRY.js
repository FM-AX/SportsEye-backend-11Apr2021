<h3>Industry Trends</h3>



<p>The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) has partnered with Australia's peak science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), to jointly conduct research into the future of Australian sport. The sports played in Australia, as well as how and why we play them, are changing over time.</p>
<p>The recent findings from <b><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/564073/The_Future_of_Australian_Sport_-_Full_Report.pdf">The Future of Australian Sport Report</a></u></b>&nbsp;will play an important role in shaping long-term policy, investment and strategic planning within government, the sport sector and broader community. The Report highlights six sports megatrends that may redefine the sport sector over the next 30 years.</p>
<p><em>A megatrend is defined as a major shift in environmental, social and economic conditions that will substantially alter the way people live. Megatrends occur at the intersection of multiple trends. A trend is defined as an important pattern of social, economic or environmental activity that will play out in the future.</em></p>
<p>Six megatrends have been identified within The Future of Australian Sport report, which will impact on the makeup of sport in Australia over the next 30 years.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Perfect Fit</strong>&nbsp;- Personalised sport for health and fitness</li>
<li><strong>From Extreme to Mainstream</strong>&nbsp;- The rise of lifestyle sports</li>
<li><strong>More than Sport</strong>&nbsp;- The attainment of health, community and overseas aid objectives via sport</li>
<li><strong>Everybody's Game</strong>&nbsp;- Demographic, generational and cultural change</li>
<li><strong>New Wealth, New Talent</strong>&nbsp;- Economic growth and sports development in Asia</li>
<li><strong>Tracksuits to Business Suits</strong>&nbsp;- Market pressures and new business models</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Netball</strong></p>
<p>The Statewide Facilities Strategy identified the following trends:-</p>

<p><em>Some of the primary participation, planning, design and management trends that may have implications for netball facility planning and provision in NSW between 2018 and 2033 are briefly summarised below.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>As the nature of the NSW community changes, sport in NSW will need to adapt what it does, how it does it; and whom it does it with, if it is to thrive into the future. </em></li>
<li><em>Understanding why males, females, adults and children participate in sport (specifically netball) in NSW and how often they participate should impact on the future size and nature of the netball facility landscape in NSW.</em></li>
<li><em>Netball NSW should understand the sport participation motivators of its various consumer segments in order to provide netball offerings which align with these motivators. Australian Sports Commission research provides key insights regarding how sport participation (in all consumer segments) is </em><strong><em>negatively impacted</em></strong><em> upon by the following participation barriers:</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Sport delivery that focuses on competition rather than fun and enjoyment;</em></li>
<li><em>A lack of ï¬‚exibility around the scheduling of sport in traditional sporting clubs;</em></li>
<li><em>Organising individuals and teams according to talent, rather than retaining friendship groups;</em></li>
<li><em>Limited opportunities for people with limited sports competency to join sporting clubs; and</em></li>
<li><em>Self-consciousness amongst adolescents and embarrassment by their lack of sporting ability.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Netball in NSW to grow, the aforementioned factors will need to be addressed, as will ensuring the facility element of the netball offering meets the needs of all current and future consumer groups.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>People want to be able to access sport and recreation opportunities easily from where they live, especially in areas where density is increasing. Local and regional linkages via cycle / walkways will grow in importance.</em></li>
<li><em>Local Government will have an increasingly important role in improving health outcomes by enabling residents to be more physically activity.</em></li>
<li><em>Maximum flexibility in sport facility design to accommodate varying community needs and forms of use will be increasingly prioritised by governments. Multi-use sport and recreation precincts and stand-alone netball facilities may need to consider incorporating opportunities for traditional and non-traditional activities.</em></li>
<li><em>Future sports facilities will need to be safe, easily accessible, with few barriers to entry, and cater for formal and informal forms of participation. Provision of safe facilities and safe access-ways is of particular importance where participation by females is concerned.</em></li>
<li><em>Lighting of sport and recreation facilities for safety and/or to extend their usage and functionality will become increasingly important. Evening (especially mid-week) competitions are likely to continue to grow.</em></li>
<li><em>Lighting of sport and recreation facilities should use contemporary technology to maximise operating viability and minimise impacts on neighbouring residents.</em></li>
<li><em>Facility design should maximise opportunities for generating increased revenue and utilisation and/or to reduce operating costs.</em></li>
<li><em>Increasing demands within limited budgets may necessitate regional scale planning of sporting facilities (particularly higher level facilities) to ensure facilities are economically and socially viable.</em></li>
<li><em>Sporting organisation partnerships with schools, the tertiary sector, other sports (etc.) should be considered in the provision of new / upgraded sporting infrastructure.</em></li>
<li><em>Sporting facility design will need to remain flexible, so as to enable opportunities for informal / non-organised activities, not just organised sport.</em></li>
<li><em>Sporting facilities should support the ability to host a variety of activities, including beyond their primary intended use (e.g. community, cultural and entertainment events), where feasible.</em></li>

<p>An overview of national netball participation provided by <b><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/research/smi/ausplay/results/sport">Ausplay</a></u></b> is presented below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The annual population estimate for Adults 15+ participating in Netball was 570,871 (or 2.8% of the Adult 15+ population).</li>
<li>Adult participation was heavily skewed towards females (507,150 or 5.0% of the female population), with females accounting for 89% of participation.</li>
<li>A very high proportion of Adult 15+ Netball participation was organised (90%), with more than two thirds of organised participation (69%) in sport clubs.</li>
<li>AusPlay estimates that 331,031 Children 0-14 participated in organised Netball out-of-school. The overwhelming majority of participation was from girls, as they represented 97% of all Children&rsquo;s out-of-school organised Netball participation.</li>
<li>Peak participation rates were among Children 12-14 and then participation steadily declined with age. However, compared to other team sports, Netball retained players for longer with strong female participation into adulthood up to 18-24 years of age.</li>
