<h3>Introduction and Rationale</h3>
<p>ActiveXchange was engaged to provide predictive member and infrastructure modelling for Netball NSW to assist with future planning, provision and membership initiatives. ActiveXchange proposed to provide these models in an online platform known as SportEye.</p>
<p>This follows on from and is guided by the Netball NSW Statewide Facilities Strategy. Key parts of the strategy are referenced in the sections below.</p>
<p>The sections in this part of the platform provide an overall context to the project and the key vision and directions driving the outcomes and priorities.</p>
