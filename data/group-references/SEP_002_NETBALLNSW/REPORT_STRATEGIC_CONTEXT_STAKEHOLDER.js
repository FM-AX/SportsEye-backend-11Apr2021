<h3>Stakeholder Engagement</h3>
<p>As part of the Statewide Facilities Strategy, extensive consultation was undertaken with associations and clubs. The following is the summary extract from the strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stakeholder Group - Netball Associations and Clubs</em></strong></p>

<p><em>The vast majority of stakeholders see great benefit / opportunity associated with the development of the Netball in NSW Statewide Facilities Strategy and applauded NNSW for undertaking the initiative. The main benefit related to Associations being able to go to their LGA with evidence to support their application for LGA support to improve / develop new facilities. </em></p>

<p><em>The level of facility related planning at Association / Club level is relatively poor and enhancing Association / Club capacity in the area of facility planning is needed.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;To increase the size and/or quality of our court facilities (including lighting)&rdquo; was rated overall as priority 4 of a list of 7 key operational areas, whilst &ldquo;To increase the size and/or quality of our ancillary facilities (e.g. club house, toilets, parking, etc.)&rdquo; rated 6 of 7. This potentially demonstrates that the current nature of the netball facilities footprint in NSW may not be </em><em>the</em><em> major concern facing the sport, but rather &ldquo;</em><em>workforce</em><em>&rdquo; and </em><em>&ldquo;participation growth&rdquo;</em><em> related issues may be more important.</em></p>

<p><em>It is relatively common for Association facilities to be at or near capacity in Winter on Saturdays. It is also apparent, that in the main, Association court usage on days other than Saturday in Winter, is relatively low; and court usage at all times in Summer is relatively low.</em></p>
