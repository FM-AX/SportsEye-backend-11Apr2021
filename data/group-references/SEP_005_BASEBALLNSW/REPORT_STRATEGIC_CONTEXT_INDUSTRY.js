<h3>Industry Trends</h3>


<p>The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) has partnered with Australia's peak science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), to jointly conduct research into the future of Australian sport. The sports played in Australia, as well as how and why we play them, are changing over time.</p>
<p>The recent findings from <b><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/564073/The_Future_of_Australian_Sport_-_Full_Report.pdf">The Future of Australian Sport Report</a></u></b>&nbsp;will play an important role in shaping long-term policy, investment and strategic planning within government, the sport sector and broader community. The Report highlights six sports megatrends that may redefine the sport sector over the next 30 years.</p>
<p><em>A megatrend is defined as a major shift in environmental, social and economic conditions that will substantially alter the way people live. Megatrends occur at the intersection of multiple trends. A trend is defined as an important pattern of social, economic or environmental activity that will play out in the future.</em></p>
<p>Six megatrends have been identified within The Future of Australian Sport report, which will impact on the makeup of sport in Australia over the next 30 years.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Perfect Fit</strong>&nbsp;- Personalised sport for health and fitness</li>
<li><strong>From Extreme to Mainstream</strong>&nbsp;- The rise of lifestyle sports</li>
<li><strong>More than Sport</strong>&nbsp;- The attainment of health, community and overseas aid objectives via sport</li>
<li><strong>Everybody's Game</strong>&nbsp;- Demographic, generational and cultural change</li>
<li><strong>New Wealth, New Talent</strong>&nbsp;- Economic growth and sports development in Asia</li>
<li><strong>Tracksuits to Business Suits</strong>&nbsp;- Market pressures and new business models</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Athletics</strong></p>
<p>Athletics, encompassing traditional track and field and recreational running is large and complex. It is both a recreational activity and competitive pursuit, which presents both opportunities and challenges, yet it has the ability to attract and provide participation opportunities for all ages and abilities. The fundamentals of athletics (run, jump, throw, walk, roll) provide the basis for almost every other athletic pursuit and therefore by default; every person, from childhood to adulthood should have the opportunity to learn and master the skills of running, jumping, throwing, walking and rolling.</p>
<p>The most recent Ausplay data can be found <b><u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/research/smi/ausplay/results/sport">here</u></b></a>. The participation summary is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The annual population estimate for Adults 15+ participating in Running/Athletics was 3,087,629 (or 15.3% of the Adult 15+ population).</li>
<li>Adult participation was fairly gender balanced, but slightly skewed towards males (16.9% of the male population), with males accounting for 54% of participation. Female Adult 15+ participation was also high (13.8% of the female population).</li>
<li>Peak participation rates among men were between 25-44 years of age (24%+), while the peak for women was earlier at 15-17 years (27.4%). Participation rates for men and women declined steadily with age after 44 years.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, the majority of Adults took part in Running/Athletics casually with conversion to organised participation relatively low at 19%. That equates to half a million Adults 15+ taking part in organised Running/Athletics through sport clubs, events, etc.</li>
<li>AusPlay estimates that about a quarter of a million (247,064) Children 0-14 participated in organised Running/Athletics out-ofschool. Unlike Adults, Children&rsquo;s participation was slightly skewed towards females (52%).</li>
</ul>
