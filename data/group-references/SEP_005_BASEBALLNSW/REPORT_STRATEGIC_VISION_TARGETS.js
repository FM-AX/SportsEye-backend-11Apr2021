<h3>Targets / Standards</h3>
<p>Based on analysis of provision rates and performance (demand conversion), targets have been established around the provision of athletics facilities for regional and metro areas. That is, what does &lsquo;good&rsquo; look like in metro and regional areas &ndash; which areas have high conversion rates and what level of provision do they have.</p>
<p>To help model the need for access to or development of additional facilities, these &lsquo;standards&rsquo; have been developed based on current and future demand forecasts. This is more relevant than member or population standards as it is based on relevant market segments and takes in to account changes in age distribution over time.</p>
<p>In order to reflect the hierarchy outlined above and to meet identified needs of Athletics NSW, a ratio of provision for synthetics tracks was also developed. Separate standards were developed for metro and regional areas to reflect demographic and spatial differences.</p>
<p>The standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metro</li>
<ul>
<li>1 facility for every 550 of demand</li>
<li>1 synthetic facility for every 3,000 of demand</li>
</ul>
<li>Regional</li>
<ul>
<li>1 facility for every 350 of demand</li>
<li>1 synthetic facility for every 2,000 of demand</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The distribution of synthetic tracks is also guided by the geographic and administrative boundaries to provide an appropriate district/regional structure.</p>
