<h3>Introduction and Rationale</h3>
<p>Xypher Consulting was engaged by Little Athletics NSW (LANSW) and Athletics NSW (ANSW) to prepare a facilities strategy for athletics in NSW. This was identified as a priority project in the One Sport Strategic Plan. The brief included the following key points:</p>
<p><em>The purpose of the Strategy is to consolidate information on existing facilities and to provide clarity on future priorities.The proposed Plan will be used to inform discussions with stakeholders ranging from government to grassroots participants.</em></p>
<p><em>The project scope will consist of:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conducting an audit of the existing athletics facilities within NSW</em></li>
<li><em>Drafting the Strategy to make recommendations on the future prioritisation of synthetic track development in NSW</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Xypher Consulting submitted a proposal to undertake the project by delivering it in a digital platform by partnering with ActiveXchange in developing an online tool now known as SportsEye (see below).</p>
<p>The sections in this part of the platform provide an overall context to the project and the key vision and directions driving the outcomes and priorities.</p>
<p><strong>SportsEye</strong></p>
<p>The SportsEye Pro platform is business intelligence and planning tool specifically designed for National and State Sporting organisations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused on growing participation and guiding investment planning</li>
<li>Working in partnership with relevant managers and staff it will -</li>
<ul>
<li>Provide a &lsquo;single source of truth&rsquo; for all relevant data held by the organisation overlaid with a range of government, industry and commercial data sets to analyse current performance and identify opportunities</li>
<li>Establish a strategic framework to guide future planning and growth initiatives</li>
<li>Create forecast demand and supply models for participation and facilities</li>
<li>Establish an implementation and resourcing strategy to prioritise actions and resources</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coordinating intelligence across your sport - simplifying decisions</strong></p>
