Over 2,561,098 member records powering the intelligence.

This platform has been developed to support both delivery and commissioning organisations to match the resident profile of suburbs with demand for specific programs and sports, acting as a match making toolkit to grow active communities.

    The platform will help different partners to collaborate more effectively, underpinning decisions with independent and up to date intelligence. For the first time demand projections have been built from hundreds of thousands of current member records.

    This is a sector collaboration that any administration / delivery organisation can join. The aim is to create more active and healthy communities. If your delivery organisation would like to get involved please email intelligence@ActiveXchange.org
