<h3>Sport Planning / Administration Structure</h3>
<p>Although Little Athletics NSW and Athletics NSW are separate entities with each organisation having its own Strategic Plan, board and management, they come together under the One Sport initiative which is replicated at the national level.</p>
<p>Under the One Sport approach, a Participation Growth Strategy was finalised in 2018. With the aim of increasing participation through higher conversion of recreational runners, engagement with schools and improved participation pathways at club level</p>
<p>At a local level, the governance approach results in the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>stand-alone clubs/centres and single use facilities;</li>
<li>stand-alone clubs/centres and single sharing facilities and working cooperatively; and</li>
<li>combined centres/clubs operating as one entity.</li>
</ul>
