</p>

<p>Australian governments at all levels play a leading role in delivering sport and sport related policies and programs. This includes providing support and funding to sporting organisations, clubs and individuals, being major investors and contributors to building and maintaining sports related infrastructure, and sponsoring the hosting of major sports events.</p>
<p>Australian sporting organisations and sports clubs&mdash;many operating as not-for-profit entities&mdash;play a pivotal role in the delivery of sport across the sector.</p>
<p>Other significant contributors to the sector include schools and universities; peak sports bodies and advocacy groups; participants whether in a playing, coaching, officiating, or administrative capacity (in a paid or volunteer basis); retailers of sporting goods and equipment; media, publishing and news agencies; health, fitness and medical practitioners; and many other service providers, organisations and community groups.</p>

Sport 2030 is Australia&rsquo;s first national sport plan &mdash; and represents the Australian Government&rsquo;s long-term commitment to seeing Australian sport thrive. Sport 2030 is the vision and the plan for sport and physical activity in Australia over the next 12 years to be delivered in partnership with Australia&rsquo;s sporting, physical activity, technology, education and corporate community. The strategic priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a more active Australia &mdash; More Australians, more active, more often;</li>
<li>Achieving sporting excellence &mdash; National pride, inspiration and motivation through international sporting success;</li>
<li>Safeguarding the integrity of sport &mdash; A fair, safe and strong sport sector free from corruption; and</li>
<li>Strengthening Australia&rsquo;s sport industry &mdash; A thriving Australian sport and recreation industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NSW Office of Sport</strong></p>
<p>State and Territory&nbsp;governments develop and implement policies and programs with a focus on&nbsp;community sport and active recreation participation, sports facility and infrastructure development, and&nbsp;high performance sport and&nbsp;talent pathway development.</p>
<p>The NSW Office of Sport have recently completed <b><u><a target="_blank" href="https://sport.nsw.gov.au/draft-regional-sport-and-active-recreation-plans">regional sport and active recreation plans</b></u></a> for the nine regions outside the Sydney Metropolitan area. Each draft Regional Sport and Active Recreation Plan focuses on achieving six outcomes by undertaking a series of region and non-region specific strategies over the next decade.</p>
<p>These outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the PARTICIPATION of adults and children in regular sport and active recreation;</li>
<li>Improve ACCESS to sport and active recreation for everyone in the region, regardless of participant background or ability;</li>
<li>Integrate PERFORMANCE PATHWAYS for participants in sport;</li>
<li>Deliver fit for purpose FACILITIES in the region;</li>
<li>Deliver sporting EVENTS which are valued by the region; and</li>
<li>Improved COLLABORATION within the sport and active recreation sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Office of Sport have also drafted District Sport Facility Plans for each of the five districts in Greater Sydney.</p>
<p><strong>Local Government</strong></p>
<p>Local governments across Australia play a significant role in supporting community sport. This support includes facilitating a range of business development resources, providing funding to clubs and individuals, building and maintaining sports related infrastructure, and sponsoring the hosting of local sports events.</p>
<p>Building a close working relationship with local government is an important step for all sporting and active recreation organisations, especially when planning for new facilities and services.</p>
<p>A key issue facing local government is ensuring that sport and recreation facilities will meet future needs, while being affordable and fit-for-purpose. To deal with this, Councils are looking at a range of strategies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a focus on multi-function and shared use facilities including schools;</li>
<li>facility consolidation; and</li>
<li>working closely with local communities, including sports clubs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Facility Funding</strong></p>
<p>The construction and ongoing operational cost of sport and recreation facilities comes from both government and private sources. From a government perspective, the cost of sport and active recreation facilities is justified by the outcomes delivered &ndash; social capital, community development, employment, health and education outcomes, tourism, etc.</p>
<p><br /> Government funding of public access sports facilities in Australia generally comes from departments/agencies overseeing infrastructure; and depending upon location, may be supported by either urban or regional planning strategies. To date, the planning and funding of sporting facilities has not been part of the brief of Sport Australia (formerly the Australian Sports Commission). Federal grants to States/Territories and/or State/Territory grants to local government authorities focus on infrastructure and economic development, but may be justified as having multiple community benefits &ndash; public health, community development, employment, tourism, education, etc. Facility planning may be linked to sport and active recreation programming, since the delivery of programs may require an investment in facilities.</p>
<p>Each State/Territory generally has three streams of sport/recreation facility planning:</p>
<ol>
<li>a major sports facility strategy which aligns with other policy areas (employment, tourism, transportation, etc.);</li>
<li>Departments of Education prioritise facility plans as part of capital investment in schools, and;</li>
<li>Departments of Sport and Recreation have funding programs/strategies to help Local Government authorities or State Sporting Organisations to develop facilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Local Government authorities also have plans for sport/recreation facilities, based upon their population and social needs.</p>
